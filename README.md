# Task 1: Software Configuration

**Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?**

Hello ðŸ˜€! First of all I would like to express my gratitude for this *awesome project!* Thank you for this amazing opportunity for people without any IT base to have a chance in **QA Testing.**

I decided to participate in the Dare IT Challenge to make my first step towards IT career. I believe this challenge can give an insight and hands-on experience in  QA Testing. This is a golden opportunity for me to see if it's something I can handle, if it's the path I want to take in my career.

As a result of this project I hope to gain some valuable knowledge, first experience and maybe *open a door to a new exciting journey!*

**See you soon!**
